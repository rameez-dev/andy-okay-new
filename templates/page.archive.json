As we have a “Pay What You Can”-model it is difficult to predict the final amount each collaboration will raise. We offer the artworks we have for a lower price leaving room for our customers to make a donation to one of our charity partners. At the end of each Fiscal Year we will go through the donations and submit the donations directly to you. <\/p><p>The second part is the reach and engagement. Each and every artist we collaborate with signs up to share the collaboration in their own channels at the release of their art. We also share the collaborations in our own SM channels and through newsletters, reaching over 10 million people per month. <\/p><p>Each charity organisation partnering up with us also receives a dedicated page on andyokay.com, with 400.000+ visitors each month. <\/p>"

That’s why using art to share a message is so powerful, since it makes people stop, and really embrace the information.  <br\/><br\/>We open up a whole new audience for our collaborating partners to talk about their important causes to people that care about our planet, but don’t actively seek out the information themself. <\/p><p>We reach as many females as males, all over the world, spanning from 18 years all the way up to 65+ years. (Almost) everybody loves beautiful art.<\/p>"

That’s why we offer this without asking for anything back. We are here to help.<\/p><p>Of course we would really appreciate if the organisation of the month mentioned Andy okay in any of their own channels during some point while the collaboration is live.
