As we have a “Pay What You Can”-model it is difficult to predict the final amount each collaboration will raise. But looking on previous collaborations a third of the profit generally equals around $100 per artwork. Which of course means times 15-25, depending on the final number of collaborating artists that specific month.<\/p><p>The second part is the reach and engagement. Each and every artist signs up to share the collaboration in their own channels at the release of their art. This means 15-25 of the world’s leading artists are raising awareness about your cause. <\/p><p>Each nonprofit organization partnering up with us also receives a dedicated page on andyokay.com, with 60.000+ visitors each month. <\/p>"

That’s why using art to share a message is so powerful, since it makes people stop, and really embrace the information.  <br\/><br\/>We open up a whole new audience for our collaborating partners to talk about their important causes to people that care about our planet, but don’t actively seek out the information themself. <\/p><p>We reach as many females as males, all over the world, spanning from 18 years all the way up to 65+ years.
