The lack of understanding, provisions and information made Jacqui realise that help and education is needed for those struggling with PTSD – along with their friends and family.<\/p><p>PTSD UK is currently the only charity in the UK dedicated to raising awareness of post-traumatic stress disorder – no matter the trauma that caused it.<\/p><p>Evidence suggests that around 70% of people who suffer with PTSD in the UK do not receive any professional help at all, and many of those who are aware they have it are not getting the help and support they need.<\/p><p>Our charity aims to raise awareness of PTSD in three main areas – it’s causes, symptoms and the treatments available. These 3 areas are of vital importance to those suffering with the condition.<\/p>",
